# Deep-Convolutional-Q-Learning-for-Pac-Man
ðŸ‘¾ Deep Convolutional Q-Learning for Pac-Man

This project implements Deep Q-Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to train an AI agent to play Pac-Man. The agent learns optimal strategies for navigating mazes, avoiding ghosts, and collecting pellets using reinforcement learning.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Uses Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with CNNs for processing visual input.

Trains the agent to maximize score while avoiding ghosts.

Includes reward shaping for faster convergence.

Visualization of the agentâ€™s learning progress over time.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python, PyTorch / TensorFlow for deep reinforcement learning.

OpenAI Gym / Custom Pac-Man Environment.

NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV for preprocessing and visualizations.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Game AI research and development.

Reinforcement learning experimentation and benchmarks.

Teaching agents strategic decision-making in dynamic environments.
